##  Assumptions Made

Mobile Framework: Flutter has been chosen for cross-platform development.
Authentication Provider:** Google Sign-In will be implemented for social login.
Task Data Storage: Initially, tasks will be stored in the app's local memory (in-session state). If time permits, local persistence (e.g., using `shared_preferences` or `hive_flutter`) will be considered, as a full backend is optional per the brief.
Crash Reporting: Firebase Crashlytics will be integrated for crash reporting.
